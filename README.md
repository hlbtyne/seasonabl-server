## seasonabl

seasonabl is an app which shows users the foods that are currently in season in the UK, as well as some recipes ideas on how to cook with them. There's currently a growing awareness of what we eat and where it comes from, and a growing want to eat food that is locally sourced, thanks to the effect that importing foods can have on the environment. seasonabl allows users to know what produce is in season and eat locally, as well as expand their food knowledge an try new things, allowing them to rely less on imported foods in order to support the environment.
